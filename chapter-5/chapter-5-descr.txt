Java supports single inheritance, by which a class may inherit from only one direct par-
ent class. Java also supports multiple levels of inheritance, by which one class may extend
another class, which in turn extends another class. You can extend a class any number of
times, allowing each descendent to gain access to its ancestor’s members.

To truly understand single inheritance, it may helpful to contrast it with multiple inheri-
tance, by which a class may have multiple direct parents. By design, Java doesn’t support
multiple inheritance in the language because studies have shown that multiple inheritance
can lead to complex, often diffi cult-to-maintain code. Java does allow one exception to the
single inheritance rule: classes may implement multiple interfaces, as you’ll see later in this
chapter.

single inheritance & multiple interface 

If the parent doesn’t have a no-argument constructor and the child doesn’t define any
constructors, the compiler will throw an error and try to insert a default no-argument
constructor into the child class.

Java allows calling a static method through an
instance variable.

Calling Constructors
Now that we have covered how to defi ne a valid constructor, we’ll show you how Java calls
the constructors. In Java, the parent constructor is always executed before the child con-
structor. For example, try to determine what the following code outputs:


Since the main() method is in the same class, it can call private methods in the
class. this() may only be called as the first line of a constructor. this.variableName
can be called from any instance method to refer to an instance variable. It cannot be
called from a static method because there is no instance of the class to refer to. Option
F is tricky. The default constructor is only written by the compiler if no user-defined
constructors were provided. this() can only be called from a constructor in the same
class. Since there can be no user-defined constructors in the class if a default construc-
tor was created, it is impossible for option F to be true.

if no constructor is defined by user, compiler defined for that default constructor.


Both instance and static initializers are able to access static variables
