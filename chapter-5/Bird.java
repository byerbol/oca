/*

	In this example, the method hasFeathers() is marked as final in the parent class Bird ,
	so the child class Penguin cannot override the parent method, resulting in a compiler error.
	Note that whether or not the child method used the final keyword is irrelevantâ€”the code
	will not compile either way.
