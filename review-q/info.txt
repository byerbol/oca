Public - can be Java indentifier because Java is case sensetive
and Public is not reserved keyword


int numGrains = 5.6; // compile error


package aquarium;
public class Water {
boolean salty = false;
}
package aquarium.jellies;
public class Water {
boolean salty = true;
}
package employee;
INSERT IMPORTS HERE
public class WaterFiller {
Water water;
}


// Which water do u use ?
import aquarium.*;
import aquarium.jellies.*;


// same class Name in the imports java can't compile it.
import aquarium.Water;
import aquarium.jellies.Water;


17. Which of the following are true? (Choose all that apply)
public class Bunny {
public static void main(String[] args) {
Bunny bun = new Bunny();
} }

Bunny is a class, bun is a reference to an object.

Q19 and 20 very difficult to me :(

System.gc() suggests that Java might wish to run the garbage collector. Java is free to ignore the request. finalize() runs if an object attempts to be garbage collected.

What does the following code output?
1: public class Salmon {
2: int count;
3: public void Salmon() {
4:
count = 4;
5: }
6: public static void main(String[] args) {
7: Salmon s = new Salmon();
8: System.out.println(s.count);
9: } }


line 3's code is not constructor )
it's a method booy.
when line 7 runs then empty constructor will be called, and count has default value of 0 (integer def value is 0).

Q23. When running a Java program, you pass just the name of the class without the .class extension like java Main ?
