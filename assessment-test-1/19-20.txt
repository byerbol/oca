 RuntimeException -> unchecked

Option A is the exception base class, which is a checked exception. Options B,
D, and E extend RuntimeException directly or indirectly and therefore are unchecked
exceptions. Option F is a throwable and not an exception, and so should not be caught
or declared. For more information, see Chapter 6.
